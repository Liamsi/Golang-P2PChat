I just started learning go and forked this repo while searching for a simple netwokrging code example (other than http). 

Just silenced `golint`, made it compile with a recent go version and using [qml.v1](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/qml.v1) instead of [v0](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/qml.v0), and slightly changed some internals, so that I could play with it in a host-only virtualbox environment. Nothing really interesting to see here.
